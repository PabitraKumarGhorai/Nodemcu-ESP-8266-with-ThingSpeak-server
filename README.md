# Nodemcu-ESP-8266-with-ThingSpeak-server
ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate, visualize and analyze live data streams in the cloud. ThingSpeak provides instant visualizations of data posted by your devices to ThingSpeak. ThingSpeak is often used for prototyping and proof of concept IoT systems that require analytics.
Here I use nodemcu to upload the data to the thingspeak server. In this project I collect the temperature data by using LM35 sensor and send this data to the thingspeak server
by using nodemcu.
